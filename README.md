# DCGAN_Image_Generation

This Project outlines the development and training of a DCGAN using the CelebA dataset. The goal was to generate realistic human faces using a generative adversarial network. The assignment involved several key steps: dataset preparation, model architecture definition, training, image generation, evaluation, and experimentation with hyperparameters and architecture modifications.
